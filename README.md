# Reverse-Geocoding-SA
Just a quick example of how reverse geocoding works with an interactive demonstration. The main purpose of this project is to teach others how to reverse geocode using Apple's MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks. 




# Files

ViewController.swift contains the meat of the learning. That is where all the MapKit and CLLocationManager delegate functions and located. There are some setup files located in the `Supporting Files` directory but are used only for setting up views.


# Installation
Simply download the `.zip` or clone the project and run on in the simulator. 
You will need to allow location services in order for the simulator to run.

## Support
Built with Swift 4.1 and Xcode 9.4
